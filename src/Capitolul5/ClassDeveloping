-what is the class supposed to do
-write all the instance variables and methods           PREP CODE-pseuodocode to figure ou the logic of the code
-write the code of the methods-------------------------/
                                                       \
                                                        TEST CODE-a class/method that is testing the code to validate it or not
-implement the class
-test the methods
-debug and reimplement if needed
-//-Extreme Programming -->write the test code before there is anything to test


-integer.parseInt("3")--> parseInt---> a method that knows to "parse" a string into an int
                                                    int cell--a variable that will hold different elements from the array
-the for loop---> for(int cell : locationCells)---/_: means "in"
                                                  \
                                                    locationCells--the array to iterate over in the loop
-post-increment operator a++;
-generate random numbers-->int random=(int) (Math.random()*5);
