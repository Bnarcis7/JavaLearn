-methods can be void but can also return values;
-the value returned must be the same type as the declared type;
-methods can have multiple parameters
-things an object knows--> instance variables
-things an objecty does--> methods
-Mark instance variables private.
-Mark getters and setters public
-instance variables always get a default value if they are unassigned(integer-0, float=0.0, booleans-false, references-null)
-local variables(in methods) do not get default value and must be initialised before used
-== to compare primitives or to see if two references refer to the same object
-equals() to see if two different objects are equal
